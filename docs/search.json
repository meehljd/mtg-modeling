    "text": "Drafting in Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a complex and dynamic format that challenges players to adapt quickly, make strategic decisions, and understand the evolving meta of each new set. In this analysis, we explore the summary and draft data for Bloomburrow, focusing on draft-level insights without diving into individual cards. We use data from Bloomburrow Premier Drafts, recorded from the 17Lands user base in MTG Arena, a best-of-one draft format where players draft in a pool and play until they win 7 games or lose 3. The Bloomburrow set was released in Arena on July 30, 2024.\nBy examining deck performance, player strategies, and various in-game factors such as mulligans and turn counts, we aim to uncover the key elements that contribute to success in this draft environment. We’ll explore how factors like deck choice, player rank, sideboarding, and the number of turns impact win rates. Additionally, we’ll investigate gameplay differences when players go first versus second and highlight how player behavior evolves throughout a ranked season. Through this analysis, we provide valuable insights to help both seasoned and new drafters make more strategic decisions in the Bloomburrow draft format and beyond.\nTo see other analyses of MTG draft data, check out the Draft Analysis page."

The ten two-color decks are the most common, aligning with the design intent of Bloomburrow, which focuses on ten two-color animal tribes. Mono-color and multi-color decks are far less common.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The rate at which the drafted deck has a given number of main colors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Bloomburrow is designed with 2-color tribal decks in mind, we’ll focus on these pairings. In Figure 2, we see the most frequent drafted decks are Black-Green, White-Green, and Red-White. On the other hand, the least drafted are Blue-Black, Blue-Red and White-Blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The rate at which the drafted deck is a given 2-color pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows the color composition of the decks. Green stands out as the most frequently drafted color, with Black and White also being popular choices. In contrast, Red and Blue are drafted far less frequently.\nThe average draft use rate per component color is 40.0%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The rate at which the drafted deck contains a given color in the main deck colors.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we examine the four decks with the largest absolute changes in use between the start and end of the time period, shown in Figure 4.

    "text": "3.2 Color Win Rates\nIn addition to analyzing the use rates of the colors, we’ll also examine their win rates. First, we calculate the weighted average win rate, which is 54.7%. As highlighted in the summary section, this win rate suggests that the 17Lands player base performs better than the general draft player base.\nFigure 5 presents the win rates for each color combination. While some mono-color decks have notably high win rates, their low use rates suggest that these results may be circumstantial due to small sample sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The rate at which the drafted deck is a given 2-color pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 6, we focus on the 2-color decks. The Black-Red Lizards: Opponents Lose Life deck boasts the highest win rate, though it has a relatively low use rate. Meanwhile, the White-Red Rabbits: Go-Wide and Black-Green Squirrels: Forage decks are the most popular and also maintain high win rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The win rate for each 2-color pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 shows the win rates for the five primary colors, based on whether they serve as a main component in a deck. For example, the “B” results reflect the win rates for Black in decks such as WB, BG, Mono-Black, and UBR.\nThe overall average win rate for the data is 54.7%. Decks featuring Black perform the best, achieving a 55.2% win rate. Green and White decks also perform well, with win rates of 55.0% and 54.8%, respectively. On the other hand, decks with Red and Blue underperform, with win rates of 53.8% and 53.2%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: The win rate for each given color in the main deck colors."

The Blue-Red Otters: Non-creature Spells deck underperforms relative to its use rate, suggesting it may be over-selected. In contrast, the Black-Red Lizards: Opponents Lose Life deck is a hidden gem, boasting the highest win rates but being picked less frequently than the average two-color deck.\nThis under-selection of Black-Red likely stems from the general underperformance of Red, leading many drafters to avoid it unless they secure strong Black-Red cards early. On the other hand, White, Green, and Black perform well, making the BG, WG, and WB decks popular and flexible choices that players can easily pivot to during drafts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Win Rate vs Use Rate of 2-Color Draft Decks"

Wedges are three-color decks built around a primary color and its two allies, while shards consist of a primary color and its two enemies. Conventional wisdom suggests that wedges are generally easier to draft than shards.\nHowever, as shown in Figure 10, the shards have a slightly higher win rate and use rate compared to the wedges. This finding is somewhat unexpected but the difference is minimal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: The win rate for shards versus wedges."

    "text": "7.1 Ranks over Time\nWe then examine the number of drafts played at each rank over time in Figure 21. Since the BLB set was released two days before the season start, I truncated the data at 08-01 to avoid the effects of rank decay.\nThe initial days are chaotic, with the BLB set launching on 07-30, and 07-31 being the first full day of recorded games. On 08-01, the new ranked season began, causing rank decay, which is especially noticeable in Mythic and Diamond gameplay.\nStarting on 08-01, we observe distinct patterns: Gold rapidly declines after an initial peak of 3,800 drafts per day. Platinum peaks during days 4-6 before dropping. Diamond shows a slower climb with a plateau between days 8-13, followed by a gradual decline. Mythic starts at zero and slowly climbs, reaching a peak of 500 drafts per day around days 13-16.\nFrom this chart, it’s unclear how much of the decline at each rank is due to player advancement versus a loss of interest after the initial excitement of a new season. In the following charts, I will normalize the data to the total drafts played to better account for the overall decrease in gameplay.\n\n\nTotal Time Interval: 19 days 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Drafts Played by Players Over Time, by Player rank.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 22, we see the number of drafts played over time. It’s notable that the release of BLB and the start of the new season coincided, driving high player interest, with a peak of 11,300 drafts on 07-31. The rate of play decayed over the weeks, reaching a low of 3,100 on 08-17.\nThe decline is nearly monotonic, with slight increases on the Saturdays of 08-04 and 08-11, indicating that weekly seasonality has only a minor impact.\nReleasing new sets clearly boosts player engagement. However, the introduction of the new season on 08-01 does not appear to have significantly increased play, though this observation is tentative. This data highlights the economic motivation for releasing new sets to drive digital engagement on Arena, and it’s likely that paper play would follow a similar trend, with increased draft activity consuming more booster packs in the weeks following a new set’s launch.\nIt would be valuable to compare this pattern across different set releases to better understand the player base’s set-by-set preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Total Drafts Played by Players Over Time.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we normalize for the total games played to observe the relative ranked play across the player base, as shown in Figure 23.\nThis normalization highlights the relative activity at each rank more clearly. After the season starts, Gold exhibits a linear decay as players progress to Platinum. Platinum maintains a prolonged plateau, indicating a balance between new players entering the rank and existing players advancing.\nDiamond and Mythic both start with minimal participation but gradually increase in play almost monotonically, albeit at different rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Normalized Drafts Played by Players of Different Ranks Over Time."

However, for the BR and UR decks, which are less frequently played, players in both elite ranks demonstrated noticeable improvements in win rates from week one to week two. This suggests that the 17Lands player base adapted and learned to optimize these less favorable decks, regardless of their rank.\nIt’s important to note that during the first week of play, the Mythic and Diamond player base is relatively small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Win Rate for given color decks for top-ranked players vs others."

See the intro notebook 00-10-introduction.ipynb\nI made a dataset for simulating booster packs. This will look at for each combination of booster pack config, sheet name, and card name. The three rates that affect expected pull rates are: - Booster Pack Config: Unique mixes of booster packs, such as some having “The List” cards or land foils. - Sheet Picks: Number of picks from each sheet type in the booster config, such as some packs having 6 picks from the commons sheets, while others get 5 picks. - Card Sheet Rate: The rate at which a card uuid occurs on the sheet. These rates are then used to create an expected pull rate. I break this into two expected pull rate. One is per uuid, which has different values for alternate cards. The other is per name, which lumps all card alternates with the same gameplay mechanics together.\nI took the above dataset and collapse it to the expected pull rates for each card and uuid, aggregating the pack configurations and sheet names.

The impact of the card is the abstract concept that we are trying to measure. The impact of a card is not directly observable, but we can infer it from the a player’s success with or without the card in the play deck.\nCommon terms for card impact can be power level or playability. These terms are often used interchangeably, but I will use impact to describe the abstract concept of a card’s ability to contribute to winning a game.\nWhile impact can not be directly measured or observed, the card’s rarity (common, uncommon, rare, mythic rare) is often used as a proxy for the cards impact. This is an imperfect measure of impact and ideally I will find a more reliable means of modeling impact.\nI’ll start a DAG with the impact. Since the impact can not be directly measured or observed, I mark it with a dashed line to indicate it is a latent variable."

    "text": "2.2 Card Success\nI am calling the outcome of using a card in a deck that card’s success. This abstract concept can take many forms. The obvious one is the win rate of a deck containing the card and can be expanded to a player’s win record when using a given deck. Other forms can be the card’s pick rate in a draft or the card’s play rate from the hand. When looking at replay data, one can also examine resource trade-off, such as the card parity - how many cards are consumed by the player versus the opponent when playing a given card.\nThe win rate can further be refined, such as the starting hand win rate, the non-starting hand win rate, and the not in hand win rate indicating the win rate if a card is played from the starting hand, played when not in starting hand, or never played.\nI infer that impact of the played cards will effect the success of the game. I’ll update the DAG to reflect this."

But changing or removing the rarity symbol on a card would have no mechanical affect. - Card Name - perhaps a bit philosophical, the name itself does not affect a card’s impact. One can have mechanically equivalent cards with different names (“…a black lotus by any other name…”). - Set - often used as a proxy, as some sets are seen as more powerful that others. - Variant Art - affects collectablity and price, but not gameplay.\nThe DAG is updated to show how attributes affect impact."

    "text": "2.4 Context within Deck Composition\nIf a card interacts well with the other cards in it’s deck, that will increase the card’s impact in a game.\nAn obvious example of this interaction is the problem of adding a mythic rare green card will to a deck without green mana. This card will not be playable and it will act as dead-weight in the deck. This card would have negative impact on game success.\nConversely, a card that adds bonuses to tokens in a deck with lots of token generation would have a large positive impact. Below I update the DAG to reflect this relationship."

This can be done in drafting, deck building, and gameplay.\nA low skilled player with high impact cards could have game success equal to a high skilled player with low impact cards. Increasing both skill and impact should increase success.\nSince a player’s skill can affect both deck composition and situational card impact, the DAG is updated accordingly. We can’t directly observe a player’s skill, so it is indicated as a latent variable."

A card that gives bonuses to all tokens in play has much higher impact when the player has many tokens in play.\nThe board state can be both permanent resources (creatures, life, cards in hand) and temporary resources (untapped lands, untapped creatures).\nThe current board state affects a card’s impact. The card can then affect the future board state. This results in a causal loop that isn’t well suited for the DAG approach, so I will only consider the current board state on card impact.\nA player’s skill also affects the board state, with skilled players building states that better favor cards to be played."

We can infer this information by estimating card sheet composition, booster deck composition, and retail sales quantities.\nFinally, all of these factors vary as a function of time. Reprintings, hype, and value will change over time, as we well know. Even the card’s impact on gameplay will change as new sets are released and old ones are phased out of formats such as Standard.\nI will dive into this topic of estimating card value after exploring card impact in draft play."

For market analysis, I’ll include the booster fun cards, as the scarcity and desirability of these cards may affect the secondary market prices and will be interesting to explore.\n\n\n4.1.2 Card Data Sources\nI’ll use the card data generously made available by the tireless folks at the open-source project MTGJSON. MTGJSON provides a comprehensive database of MTG cards, including card attributes, card text, and card prices. The data is available in JSON format, which I’ll convert to a pandas DataFrame for analysis.\nMTGJSON sources a lot of data from Scryfall, which has an excellent webapp for exploring MTG card data.\nMTGJSON sources the booster pack composition data from. The source code provided by taw on github contains estimated booster pack composition probabilities. He also provides a webapp at mtg.wtf. Note that booster pack composition is proprietary information of Wizards of the Coast, and the above probabilities are estimates.\nSee the 01-00-mtgjson-data-intro notebook for more details on the data sources."

    "text": "4.2 Play Format Scope\n\n4.2.1 Limited Play\nFor game play, I will look at limited formats, such as Draft and Sealed Deck. Constructed formats, such as Standard, Modern, and Legacy, are out of scope for now. This is due to the complexity of the metagame and the vast number of cards available for deck construction.\nDraft play also allows us to study three types of player skill. First, there is the skill of drafting the best cards from the draft pool based on one’s currently drafted cards. Second, there is the skill of deck construction from the drafted cards. Third, there is the skill of playing the deck in a tournament setting.\nSealed and constructed formats are also interesting, but exclude the drafting skill. Constructed formats also require a deep understanding of the metagame, which is out of scope for now.\n\n\n4.2.2 MTG Arena Draft\nI will specifically look at the Draft format on MTG Arena. MTG Arena is an online platform for playing MTG. The Draft format on MTG Arena is a popular way to play limited MTG. In the Draft format, players open booster packs and pick one card from the pack. The remaining cards are passed to the next player. This process continues until all cards are picked. Players then construct a deck from the picked cards and play a tournament with the constructed deck.\nMTG Arena offers several Draft formats. I will focus on the Premier Draft format, which is a best-of-one (Bo1) format. In the Premier Draft format, players draft against other players in a pod of 8 players. Players play a tournament with the drafted deck. Players play until they reach 7 wins or 3 losses. Players have a sideboard and are allowed to change the deck composition between games.\nOther formats include Quick Draft, which also Bo1, but the drafting process in against a pool of bots, and play is against players with independent draft pools. Traditional Draft is a best-of-three (Bo3) format. Sealed Deck is another limited format where players open 6 booster packs and construct a deck from the opened cards. These are out of scope for now.\n\n\n4.2.3 Draft Play Data Sources\nFor draft play, I will used data from 17lands. They compile data from their user base to provide draft pick data. The data includes the draft pick order, the cards picked, and the win rate of the deck.\nSee the 02-10-draft-data-intro notebook for more information on the draft data."

    "text": "Drafting in Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a complex and dynamic format that challenges players to adapt quickly, make strategic decisions, and understand the evolving meta of each new set. In this analysis, we explore the summary and draft data for Bloomburrow, focusing on draft-level insights without diving into individual cards. We use data from Bloomburrow Premier Drafts, recorded from the 17Lands user base in MTG Arena, a best-of-one draft format where players draft in a pool and play until they win 7 games or lose 3. The Bloomburrow set was released in Arena on July 30, 2024.\nBy examining deck performance, player strategies, and various in-game factors such as mulligans and turn counts, we aim to uncover the key elements that contribute to success in this draft environment. We’ll explore how factors like deck choice, player rank, sideboarding, and the number of turns impact win rates. Additionally, we’ll investigate gameplay differences when players go first versus second and highlight how player behavior evolves throughout a ranked season. Through this analysis, we provide valuable insights to help both seasoned and new drafters make more strategic decisions in the Bloomburrow draft format and beyond.\nTo see other analyses of MTG draft data, check out the Draft Analysis page."

    "text": "3.1 Color Frequency\nWe start by examining the frequency of decks drafted for each color combination in Figure 1. The ten two-color decks are the most common, aligning with the design intent of Bloomburrow, which focuses on ten two-color animal tribes. Mono-color and multi-color decks are far less common.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The rate at which the drafted deck has a given number of main colors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Bloomburrow is designed with 2-color tribal decks in mind, we’ll focus on these pairings. In Figure 2, we see the most frequent drafted decks are Black-Green, White-Green, and Red-White.

    "text": "3.2 Color Win Rates\nIn addition to analyzing the use rates of the colors, we’ll also examine their win rates. First, we calculate the weighted average win rate, which is 54.7%. As highlighted in the summary section, this win rate suggests that the 17Lands player base performs better than the general draft player base.\nFigure 5 presents the win rates for each color combination. While some mono-color decks have notably high win rates, their low use rates suggest that these results may be circumstantial due to small sample sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The rate at which the drafted deck is a given 2-color pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 6, we focus on the 2-color decks. The Black-Red Lizards: Opponents Lose Life deck boasts the highest win rate, though it has a relatively low use rate. Meanwhile, the White-Red Rabbits: Go-Wide and Black-Green Squirrels: Forage decks are the most popular and also maintain high win rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The win rate for each 2-color pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 shows the win rates for the five primary colors, based on whether they serve as a main component in a deck. For example, the “B” results reflect the win rates for Black in decks such as WB, BG, Mono-Black, and UBR.\nThe overall average win rate for the data is 54.7%. Decks featuring Black perform the best, achieving a 55.2% win rate. Green and White decks also perform well, with win rates of 55.0% and 54.8%, respectively. On the other hand, decks with Red and Blue underperform, with win rates of 53.8% and 53.2%.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[23], line 2\n      1 for color in [\"W\", \"U\", \"B\", \"R\", \"G\"]:\n----&gt; 2     color_wins[color] = color_wins[\"main_colors\"].apply(\n      3         lambda x: True if color in x else False\n      4     )\n      6 dfs = []\n      8 for color in [\"W\", \"U\", \"B\", \"R\", \"G\"]:\n\nFile c:\\Users\\Josh.Meehl\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\series.py:4760, in Series.apply(self, func, convert_dtype, args, by_row, **kwargs)\n   4625 def apply(\n   4626     self,\n   4627     func: AggFuncType,\n   (...)\n   4632     **kwargs,\n   4633 ) -&gt; DataFrame | Series:\n   4634     \"\"\"\n   4635     Invoke function on values of Series.\n   4636 \n   (...)\n   4751     dtype: float64\n   4752     \"\"\"\n   4753     return SeriesApply(\n   4754         self,\n   4755         func,\n   4756         convert_dtype=convert_dtype,\n   4757         by_row=by_row,\n   4758         args=args,\n   4759         kwargs=kwargs,\n-&gt; 4760     ).apply()\n\nFile c:\\Users\\Josh.Meehl\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\apply.py:1207, in SeriesApply.apply(self)\n   1204     return self.apply_compat()\n   1206 # self.func is Callable\n-&gt; 1207 return self.apply_standard()\n\nFile c:\\Users\\Josh.Meehl\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\apply.py:1287, in SeriesApply.apply_standard(self)\n   1281 # row-wise access\n   1282 # apply doesn't have a `na_action` keyword and for backward compat reasons\n   1283 # we need to give `na_action=\"ignore\"` for categorical data.\n   1284 # TODO: remove the `na_action=\"ignore\"` when that default has been changed in\n   1285 #  Categorical (GH51645).\n   1286 action = \"ignore\" if isinstance(obj.dtype, CategoricalDtype) else None\n-&gt; 1287 mapped = obj._map_values(\n   1288     mapper=curried, na_action=action, convert=self.convert_dtype\n   1289 )\n   1291 if len(mapped) and isinstance(mapped[0], ABCSeries):\n   1292     # GH#43986 Need to do list(mapped) in order to get treated as nested\n   1293     #  See also GH#25959 regarding EA support\n   1294     return obj._constructor_expanddim(list(mapped), index=obj.index)\n\nFile c:\\Users\\Josh.Meehl\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\base.py:921, in IndexOpsMixin._map_values(self, mapper, na_action, convert)\n    918 if isinstance(arr, ExtensionArray):\n    919     return arr.map(mapper, na_action=na_action)\n--&gt; 921 return algorithms.map_array(arr, mapper, na_action=na_action, convert=convert)\n\nFile c:\\Users\\Josh.Meehl\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\algorithms.py:1814, in map_array(arr, mapper, na_action, convert)\n   1812 values = arr.astype(object, copy=False)\n   1813 if na_action is None:\n-&gt; 1814     return lib.map_infer(values, mapper, convert=convert)\n   1815 else:\n   1816     return lib.map_infer_mask(\n   1817         values, mapper, mask=isna(values).view(np.uint8), convert=convert\n   1818     )\n\nFile lib.pyx:2917, in pandas._libs.lib.map_infer()\n\nCell In[23], line 3, in &lt;lambda&gt;(x)\n      1 for color in [\"W\", \"U\", \"B\", \"R\", \"G\"]:\n      2     color_wins[color] = color_wins[\"main_colors\"].apply(\n----&gt; 3         lambda x: True if color in x else False\n      4     )\n      6 dfs = []\n      8 for color in [\"W\", \"U\", \"B\", \"R\", \"G\"]:\n\nTypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[24], line 5\n      1 # | label: fig-component-color-wins\n      2 # | fig-cap: \"The win rate for each given color in the main deck colors.\"\n      4 sns.barplot(\n----&gt; 5     data=df,\n      6     x=\"win_rate\",\n      7     y=\"component_color\",\n      8     hue=\"component_color\",\n      9     palette=color_palette,\n     10 )\n     11 plt.gca().set(xlim=(0.46, 0.56))\n     13 symbols.add_tick_symbols(scale=0.5)\n\nNameError: name 'df' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7"

The Blue-Red Otters: Non-creature Spells deck underperforms relative to its use rate, suggesting it may be over-selected. In contrast, the Black-Red Lizards: Opponents Lose Life deck is a hidden gem, boasting the highest win rates but being picked less frequently than the average two-color deck.\nThis under-selection of Black-Red likely stems from the general underperformance of Red, leading many drafters to avoid it unless they secure strong Black-Red cards early. On the other hand, White, Green, and Black perform well, making the BG, WG, and WB decks popular and flexible choices that players can easily pivot to during drafts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Win Rate vs Use Rate of 2-Color Draft Decks"

    "text": "7.1 Ranks over Time\nWe then examine the number of drafts played at each rank over time in Figure 21. Since the BLB set was released two days before the season start, I truncated the data at 08-01 to avoid the effects of rank decay.\nThe initial days are chaotic, with the BLB set launching on 07-30, and 07-31 being the first full day of recorded games. On 08-01, the new ranked season began, causing rank decay, which is especially noticeable in Mythic and Diamond gameplay.\nStarting on 08-01, we observe distinct patterns: Gold rapidly declines after an initial peak of 3,800 drafts per day. Platinum peaks during days 4-6 before dropping. Diamond shows a slower climb with a plateau between days 8-13, followed by a gradual decline. Mythic starts at zero and slowly climbs, reaching a peak of 500 drafts per day around days 13-16.\nFrom this chart, it’s unclear how much of the decline at each rank is due to player advancement versus a loss of interest after the initial excitement of a new season. In the following charts, I will normalize the data to the total drafts played to better account for the overall decrease in gameplay.\n\n\nTotal Time Interval: 41 days 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Drafts Played by Players Over Time, by Player rank.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 22, we see the number of drafts played over time. It’s notable that the release of BLB and the start of the new season coincided, driving high player interest, with a peak of 11,300 drafts on 07-31. The rate of play decayed over the weeks, reaching a low of 3,100 on 08-17.\nThe decline is nearly monotonic, with slight increases on the Saturdays of 08-04 and 08-11, indicating that weekly seasonality has only a minor impact.\nReleasing new sets clearly boosts player engagement. However, the introduction of the new season on 08-01 does not appear to have significantly increased play, though this observation is tentative. This data highlights the economic motivation for releasing new sets to drive digital engagement on Arena, and it’s likely that paper play would follow a similar trend, with increased draft activity consuming more booster packs in the weeks following a new set’s launch.\nIt would be valuable to compare this pattern across different set releases to better understand the player base’s set-by-set preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Total Drafts Played by Players Over Time.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we normalize for the total games played to observe the relative ranked play across the player base, as shown in Figure 23.\nThis normalization highlights the relative activity at each rank more clearly. After the season starts, Gold exhibits a linear decay as players progress to Platinum. Platinum maintains a prolonged plateau, indicating a balance between new players entering the rank and existing players advancing.\nDiamond and Mythic both start with minimal participation but gradually increase in play almost monotonically, albeit at different rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Normalized Drafts Played by Players of Different Ranks Over Time."

We use data from Bloomburrow Premier Drafts, recorded from the 17Lands user base in MTG Arena, a best-of-one draft format where players draft in a pool and play until they win 7 games or lose 3. The Bloomburrow set was released in Arena on July 30, 2024.\nBy examining deck performance, player strategies, and various in-game factors such as mulligans and turn counts, we aim to uncover the key elements that contribute to success in this draft environment. We’ll explore how factors like deck choice, player rank, sideboarding, and the number of turns impact win rates. Additionally, we’ll investigate gameplay differences when players go first versus second and highlight how player behavior evolves throughout a ranked season.

On the other hand, the least drafted are Blue-Black, Blue-Red and White-Blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The rate at which the drafted deck is a given 2-color pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows the color composition of the decks. Green stands out as the most frequently drafted color, with Black and White also being popular choices. In contrast, Red and Blue are drafted far less frequently.\nThe average draft use rate per component color is 40.0%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The rate at which the drafted deck contains a given color in the main deck colors.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we examine the four decks with the largest absolute changes in use between the start and end of the time period, shown in Figure 4. The White-Green (WG) and White-Black (WB) decks exhibit the largest increases in use, while the Blue-Red (UR) and White-Red (WR) decks show the most significant decreases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Frequency of Drafted Decks by Two-Color Pair: This figure shows the rate at which different two-color pairs are drafted, highlighting trends and preferences in deck selection over time."

    "text": "3.2 Color Win Rates\nIn addition to analyzing the use rates of the colors, we’ll also examine their win rates. First, we calculate the weighted average win rate, which is 54.7%. As highlighted in the summary section, this win rate suggests that the 17Lands player base performs better than the general draft player base.\nFigure 5 presents the win rates for each color combination. While some mono-color decks have notably high win rates, their low use rates suggest that these results may be circumstantial due to small sample sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The rate at which the drafted deck is a given 2-color pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 6, we focus on the 2-color decks. The Black-Red Lizards: Opponents Lose Life deck boasts the highest win rate, though it has a relatively low use rate. Meanwhile, the White-Red Rabbits: Go-Wide and Black-Green Squirrels: Forage decks are the most popular and also maintain high win rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The win rate for each 2-color pair.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 shows the win rates for the five primary colors, based on whether they serve as a main component in a deck. For example, the “B” results reflect the win rates for Black in decks such as WB, BG, Mono-Black, and UBR.\nThe overall average win rate for the data is 54.7%. Decks featuring Black perform the best, achieving a 55.2% win rate. Green and White decks also perform well, with win rates of 55.0% and 54.8%, respectively. On the other hand, decks with Red and Blue underperform, with win rates of 53.8% and 53.2%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: The win rate for each given color in the main deck colors."

I selected the four decks with the largest absolute changes in win rate between the start and end of the period. In Figure 8, we see that the White-Red (WR), White-Black (WB), and another White-Red (WR) deck start with high win rates but gradually decline over time.

    "text": "3.4 Color Freq vs Win Rate\nNext, let’s compare the use rate to the win rate to see if the player base is well-calibrated in their deck selections based on performance.\nIn Figure 9, we observe that most of the two-color decks align along a straight line, indicating a balanced relationship between use rate and win rate, with two notable outliers. The Blue-Red Otters: Non-creature Spells deck underperforms relative to its use rate, suggesting it may be over-selected. In contrast, the Black-Red Lizards: Opponents Lose Life deck is a hidden gem, boasting the highest win rates but being picked less frequently than the average two-color deck.\nThis under-selection of Black-Red likely stems from the general underperformance of Red, leading many drafters to avoid it unless they secure strong Black-Red cards early. On the other hand, White, Green, and Black perform well, making the BG, WG, and WB decks popular and flexible choices that players can easily pivot to during drafts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Win Rate vs Use Rate of 2-Color Draft Decks"

Wedges are three-color decks built around a primary color and its two allies, while shards consist of a primary color and its two enemies. Conventional wisdom suggests that wedges are generally easier to draft than shards.\nHowever, as shown in Figure 10, the shards have a slightly higher win rate and use rate compared to the wedges. This finding is somewhat unexpected but the difference is minimal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: The win rate for shards versus wedges."

    "text": "7.1 Ranks over Time\nWe then examine the number of drafts played at each rank over time in Figure 21. Since the BLB set was released two days before the season start, I truncated the data at 08-01 to avoid the effects of rank decay.\nThe initial days are chaotic, with the BLB set launching on 07-30, and 07-31 being the first full day of recorded games. On 08-01, the new ranked season began, causing rank decay, which is especially noticeable in Mythic and Diamond gameplay.\nStarting on 08-01, we observe distinct patterns: Gold rapidly declines after an initial peak of 3,800 drafts per day. Platinum peaks during days 4-6 before dropping. Diamond shows a slower climb with a plateau between days 8-13, followed by a gradual decline. Mythic starts at zero and slowly climbs, reaching a peak of 500 drafts per day around days 13-16.\nFrom this chart, it’s unclear how much of the decline at each rank is due to player advancement versus a loss of interest after the initial excitement of a new season. In the following charts, I will normalize the data to the total drafts played to better account for the overall decrease in gameplay.\n\n\nTotal Time Interval: 19 days 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Drafts Played by Players Over Time, by Player rank.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 22, we see the number of drafts played over time. It’s notable that the release of BLB and the start of the new season coincided, driving high player interest, with a peak of 11,300 drafts on 07-31. The rate of play decayed over the weeks, reaching a low of 3,100 on 08-17.\nThe decline is nearly monotonic, with slight increases on the Saturdays of 08-04 and 08-11, indicating that weekly seasonality has only a minor impact.\nReleasing new sets clearly boosts player engagement. However, the introduction of the new season on 08-01 does not appear to have significantly increased play, though this observation is tentative. This data highlights the economic motivation for releasing new sets to drive digital engagement on Arena, and it’s likely that paper play would follow a similar trend, with increased draft activity consuming more booster packs in the weeks following a new set’s launch.\nIt would be valuable to compare this pattern across different set releases to better understand the player base’s set-by-set preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Total Drafts Played by Players Over Time.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we normalize for the total games played to observe the relative ranked play across the player base, as shown in Figure 23.\nThis normalization highlights the relative activity at each rank more clearly. After the season starts, Gold exhibits a linear decay as players progress to Platinum. Platinum maintains a prolonged plateau, indicating a balance between new players entering the rank and existing players advancing.\nDiamond and Mythic both start with minimal participation but gradually increase in play almost monotonically, albeit at different rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Normalized Drafts Played by Players of Different Ranks Over Time."

However, for the BR and UR decks, which are less frequently played, players in both elite ranks demonstrated noticeable improvements in win rates from week one to week two. This suggests that the 17Lands player base adapted and learned to optimize these less favorable decks, regardless of their rank.\nIt’s important to note that during the first week of play, the Mythic and Diamond player base is relatively small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Win Rate for given color decks for top-ranked players vs others."
