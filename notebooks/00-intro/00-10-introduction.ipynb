    "\n",
    "This project is my take on applying data science to Magic: The Gathering (MTG) collectable card game.  \n",
    "\n",
    "MTG can be fodder for may aspects data science.  Here is a sampler of concepts I would like to explore:\n",
    "- __Regression:__ Predict card's expected mana cost given its attributes and keywords.\n",
    "- __LLMs:__ Generate numeric representations from card descriptions with encoder LLMs.  Use representations for predictive tasks.\n",
    "- __Network Science:__ Bipartite graphs of deck-card relationships.  Identify communities in card one-mode projection.\n",
    "- __Graph Neural Networks:__ Predict deck win rate with given card compositions.\n",
    "- __Bayesian Inference:__ Posterior distribution of a booster pack's value given the pack composition and secondary market prices.\n",
    "- __Time-Series Analysis:__ Predict card price on secondary market $d$ days after set release.\n",
    "- __Hidden Markov Models:__ Estimation of board state.  For example, estimate the states from [Quadrant Theory](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/quadrant-theory-2014-08-20).  These states are 'opening', 'parity', 'winning', or 'losing' state.\n",
    "- __Reinforcement Learning:__ Maximize the outcome of combat stage, given the board state of potentially attacking and defending creatures.\n",
    "- __Optimization__: Optimize win rate of a deck, given constraints such as maximum market cost or number of mythic rares.\n"

    "\n",
    "I will specifically look at the Draft format on [MTG Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena).  MTG Arena is an online platform for playing MTG.  The Draft format on MTG Arena is a popular way to play limited MTG.  In the Draft format, players open booster packs and pick one card from the pack.  The remaining cards are passed to the next player.  This process continues until all cards are picked.  Players then construct a deck from the picked cards and play a tournament with the constructed deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "MTG Arena offers several Draft formats.  I will focus on the [Premier Draft](https://magicarena.fandom.com/wiki/Premier_Draft) format, which is a best-of-one (Bo1) format.  In the Premier Draft format, players draft against other players in a pod of 8 players.  Players play a tournament with the drafted deck.  Players play until they reach 7 wins or 3 losses.  Players have a sideboard and are allowed to change the deck composition between games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other formats include Quick Draft, which also Bo1, but the drafting process in against a pool of bots, and play is against players with independent draft pools.  Traditional Draft is a best-of-three (Bo3) format.  Sealed Deck is another limited format where players open 6 booster packs and construct a deck from the opened cards.  These are out of scope for now."
