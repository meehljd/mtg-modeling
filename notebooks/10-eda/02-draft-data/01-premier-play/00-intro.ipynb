    "\n",
    "I have always been curious about Draft format in MTG, as it requires one to be good at the game, but also building competitive decks in a highly constrained environment.  I have been analyzing the latests sets to see how they each perform in draft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently I have analyzed the deck performance for the recent sets.  Soon I will add analysis at the card level to see which cards are the most valuable in draft."

    "# MTG Arena Draft\n",
    "\n",
    "These analyses is from players on [MTG Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena).  MTG Arena is an online platform for playing MTG.  The Draft format on MTG Arena is a popular way to play limited MTG.  In the Draft format, players open booster packs and pick one card from the pack.  The remaining cards are passed to the next player.  This process continues until all cards are picked.  Players then construct a deck from the picked cards and play a tournament with the constructed deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "MTG Arena offers several Draft formats.  I will focus on the [Premier Draft](https://magicarena.fandom.com/wiki/Premier_Draft) format, which is a best-of-one (Bo1) format.  In the Premier Draft format, players draft against other players in a pod of 8 players.  Players play a tournament with the drafted deck.  Players play until they reach 7 wins or 3 losses.  Players have a sideboard and are allowed to change the deck composition between games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other formats include Quick Draft, which also Bo1, but the drafting process in against a pool of bots, and play is against players with independent draft pools.  Traditional Draft is a best-of-three (Bo3) format.  Sealed Deck is another limited format where players open 6 booster packs and construct a deck from the opened cards.  These are out of scope for now."
